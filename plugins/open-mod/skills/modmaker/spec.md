# Spec — write the design contract

Goal: freeze the intake into `SPEC.md` in the work dir. This is the contract every
later stage reads. Also seed `PLAN.md` (stage checklist) and `MEMORY.md`.

> **Work dir = a dedicated empty outer folder whose name is NOT `<ModName>`** (e.g.
> `<modname>-mod`). Create it now and write these three files there; `scaffold.md`
> then `cd`s into it and runs `dotnet new` (the template scatters into CWD and makes
> a `<ModName>/` resource subdir, so the outer name must differ — see scaffold.md
> step 1). Do **not** name the work dir `<ModName>`.

## Write `SPEC.md`

Use the block for the element type. **Relic:**

```markdown
# SPEC — <Mod Name>

- **element**: relic
- **class name**: <PascalCase, no spaces>   e.g. GamblersCoin
- **mod name**: <PascalCase = csproj/assembly/manifest id>   usually = class name for a single-element mod
- **author**: <author>
- **rarity**: Common | Uncommon | Rare | Shop | Event | Ancient | Starter
- **pool**: SharedRelicPool | Ironclad/Silent/Defect/Regent/Necrobinder
- **trigger**: <plain language> → hook: <AfterSideTurnStart + TurnNumber<=1 | ...>
- **effect**: <precise game-terms description, with numbers>
- **display**:
  - title: <shown name>
  - description: <hover text the player reads>
  - flavor: <flavor line>
- **art**: placeholder | generate  (one mod-level choice — see "Art plan" below; `relic`
  icons are wired for generate, 256×256, live-verified)
- **derived ids** (compute now, using the recipe's loc-key rule):
  - Id.Entry: `<NS_UPPER>-<SLUG>`
  - loc keys: `<NS_UPPER>-<SLUG>.{title,description,flavor}`
  - icon slug: `<slug>.png`
```

**Potion** (usage/target replace trigger; loc table is `potions`, no flavor, plus an
optional `selectionScreenPrompt`; art is a loose 256×256 PNG icon, like relic/power):

```markdown
# SPEC — <Mod Name>

- **element**: potion
- **class name**: <PascalCase, no spaces>   e.g. SwiftBrew
- **mod name**: <PascalCase = csproj/assembly/manifest id>
- **author**: <author>
- **rarity**: Common | Uncommon | Rare | Event | Token
- **pool**: SharedPotionPool | Ironclad/Silent/Defect/Regent/Necrobinder
- **usage**: CombatOnly | AnyTime | Automatic
- **target**: AnyPlayer (self-buff) | AnyEnemy (one enemy) | AllEnemies
- **effect**: <precise game-terms description, with numbers>
- **display**:
  - title: <shown name>
  - description: <hover text the player reads>
  - selectionScreenPrompt: <only if the effect prompts a choice; else omit>
- **art**: placeholder | generate (a `potion` icon is a loose 256×256 PNG, generate-wired
  and live-verified — same as relic/power; see `reference/art-contract.md`)
- **derived ids** (compute now, using the recipe's loc-key rule):
  - Id.Entry: `<NS_UPPER>-<SLUG>`
  - loc keys (table `potions`): `<NS_UPPER>-<SLUG>.{title,description}`
```

**Card** (cost/type/target + upgrade replace trigger; loc table is `cards`, no flavor,
plus an optional `selectionScreenPrompt`; art is the scaffolded card portrait):

```markdown
# SPEC — <Mod Name>

- **element**: card
- **class name**: <PascalCase, no spaces>   e.g. BladeDance
- **mod name**: <PascalCase = csproj/assembly/manifest id>
- **author**: <author>
- **cost**: <energy int, default 1>
- **type**: Attack | Skill | Power
- **rarity**: Basic | Common | Uncommon | Rare
- **pool**: ColorlessCardPool | Ironclad/Silent/Defect/Regent/Necrobinder
- **target**: AnyEnemy (one enemy) | AllEnemies | Self (block / self-buff)
- **effect**: <precise game-terms description, with numbers>
- **vars**: <the DynamicVars, e.g. DamageVar 6; BlockVar 5; PowerVar<StrengthPower> 2>
- **upgrade**: <what OnUpgrade bumps, e.g. Damage +3>
- **needs custom power?**: <no | name of the buff/debuff to author via recipes/power.md>
- **display**:
  - title: <shown name>
  - description: <hover text; use {Damage:diff()} style placeholders for scaling numbers>
  - selectionScreenPrompt: <only if the effect prompts a choice; else omit>
- **art**: placeholder | generate  (one mod-level choice — see "Art plan" below;
  generate is wired for all four types: `card` / `relic` / `power` / `potion`)
- **derived ids** (compute now, using the recipe's loc-key rule):
  - Id.Entry: `<NS_UPPER>-<SLUG>`
  - loc keys (table `cards`): `<NS_UPPER>-<SLUG>.{title,description}`
```

**Interaction block** (add ONLY for a multi-element / combo mod — omit it for a single
element). This is what the tier-2 harness walks to prove elements *link*, not just load.
List each dependency pair **source → dependent**, and the dependent's own marker that
must fire when the source is driven. Order matters: the harness drives the source, then
asserts the dependent's marker.

```markdown
- **interaction** (combos only; omit for single elements):
  - <SourceElement> (<type>, id `<NS_UPPER>-<SRC_SLUG>`) → <DependentElement> (<type>,
    id `<NS_UPPER>-<DEP_SLUG>`): driving the source makes the dependent fire.
    - assert marker: `[T2MOD-SELFTEST] <DependentName> fired: <what>`
  - (one line per link; e.g. card "Emberstrike" applies custom power "Kindled" →
    the Kindled power's start-of-turn hook logs its own fired: marker)
```

A single element with a **custom power dependency** (a card that applies a power you
authored) IS a combo for tier-2 purposes — record it here so the harness asserts the
power's marker, not just the card's.

**Derive the ids now**, not later — the loc-key derivation is the #1 silent
failure, and it's identical for relics and potions. Query the sts2-api skill
("relic/potion loc-key derivation rule") or read the recipe if unsure. Worked
example: class `GamblersCoin` in namespace `GamblersCoin.*` → `GAMBLERSCOIN-GAMBLERS_COIN`.

## Art plan (one mod-level choice — the §7.1 decision)

The mod gets **one** art decision, taken from the interview (asked at most once, never
per sprite): **placeholder** (the default — do nothing, the template's built-in art
shows; keeps the loop fast and the mod immediately testable) or **generate** (produce
custom sprites via `author.md`'s art step + `tools/gen_sprite.py`). Record it in
`SPEC.md`'s `**art**` line, plus one overall subject/style note if `generate`, so
`author.md` can build each prompt. When the mod has several cards, `author.md` fills the
per-card subject from each card's SPEC at generate time — but the placeholder-vs-generate
choice was made once, for the whole mod.

Rules for this round:

- **Placeholder is the default and needs no backend, no key, no dev box.** If the user
  didn't ask for custom art, leave it placeholder — this is exactly the current,
  already-verified behavior (no regression).
- **`generate` is wired for all four element types — `card`, `relic`, `power`, `potion`**
  (all live-verified — card 1000×760; relic/power/potion 256×256 loose PNGs;
  `reference/art-contract.md`).
- **`generate` needs a user-supplied backend** (an OpenAI-compatible image endpoint) via
  an `art-backend.json` the user configures. If they chose generate but have no backend,
  fall back to placeholder and say so — never block the pipeline on art.

## Seed `PLAN.md`

```markdown
# PLAN — <Mod Name>
- [x] interview
- [x] spec
- [ ] scaffold
- [ ] author
- [ ] art (per SPEC art plan: placeholder = nothing to do; generate = gen_sprite.py)
- [ ] build
- [ ] verify (tier-1 load)
- [ ] verify (tier-2 effect, automated via the self-test harness)
```

Update the checkboxes as you finish each stage — this is what resume-check reads.

## Seed `MEMORY.md`

Start it with the derived ids and any decisions, so nothing is re-derived later:

```markdown
# MEMORY — <Mod Name>
- Id.Entry: <...>
- loc keys: <...>
- decisions: rarity=Common (default), pool=Shared (default)
```

## Confirm with the user

Show a **plain-language** summary and get a yes before scaffolding:

> (relic) I'll build **<Title>**, a Common relic. At the start of combat it <effect
> in plain words>. It'll drop for any character, with placeholder art for now. Sound right?
>
> (potion) I'll build **<Title>**, a Common potion you can use <in combat / any
> time>. When used it <effect in plain words>. Placeholder art for now. Sound right?
>
> (card) I'll build **<Title>**, a Common <Attack/Skill/Power> card that costs
> <N> energy. When played it <effect in plain words>; upgrading it <upgrade in plain
> words>. It'll appear for any character. <art line>. Sound right?

For the **<art line>**, reflect the SPEC art plan: "with placeholder art for now" (the
fast default), or "with custom art I'll generate for the portrait" if they chose
generate for a card. Keep it one clause — don't turn the confirmation into an art
interview (that already happened in `interview.md` / this stage's art plan).

If they change something, update `SPEC.md` before moving on. Then go to `scaffold.md`.
